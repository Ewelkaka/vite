<!-- This file is used to set up the basic HTML structure for a Qwik application with TypeScript. -->
<!-- It includes the necessary meta tags, links to the favicon, and a script to load the main TypeScript file. -->
<!-- The <div id="app"></div> serves as the root element for the Qwik application, where the Qwik components will be rendered. -->
<!-- The script tag with type="module" ensures that the main TypeScript file is loaded as a module, allowing for modern JavaScript features and TypeScript support. -->
<!-- The title of the page is set to          "Vite + Qwik + TS", indicating that this is a Vite project using Qwik with TypeScript. -->
<!-- The <meta> tags ensure proper character encoding and responsive design, making the application accessible on various devices. -->
<!-- The <link> tag for the favicon provides a visual icon for the application, enhancing user experience. -->
<!-- Overall, this HTML file serves as the entry point for the Qwik application, setting up the environment for the Qwik framework to function correctly with TypeScript. -->
  <!-- The use of TypeScript allows for type safety and better development experience, making it easier to write and maintain the code. -->
